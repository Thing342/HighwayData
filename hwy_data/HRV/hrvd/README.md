**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- `D10`: A4 wp is indicated "1" on OSM, D41 wp "2", Z3079 wp "3" et cetera. However, D41 is "1" on GSV, Z3079 "2" et cetera. The recently opened segment (September 2ß16) is not yet on GSV but numbered with "1" and "2" on OSM again! BM is like GSV but the new segment is missing. I've decided to go with A3, D41, Z3070 et cetera wp labels for the time being.
- `D12` is announced to be opened in April 2017; not yet added to csv files
- Numbering is usually not used on signage but there are km posts which are quite small and hard to find. I've checked 15 routes only and I always found a km post! At additional 2 routes GSV and GM still had old numbering. For that reason, I'll rely on wikipedia and OSM only.
- `D125` (<1mi) exists according to the sources but not on OSM. It's on GM with a different shield but nothing on GSV.
- `D316` is/was near A4 according to wikipedia but the drafted route (OSM) near Nova Gradiska seems to be new and it's not yet on GSV.
- `D403` is planned according to wikipedia (to be opened early 2015) but existing according to wegenwiki on "old roads". It's not yet on OSM, GM or GSV.
- `D427` extension is u/c
- `D77`, `D232`, `D431`, `D537` and `D538` are new D roads since October 2016
- `D431` is 400m only, exact location unknown
- `D537` extension is u/c (to be opened Mid 2017)
- `D538` extension is u/c (to be opened Mid 2017)
