**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- No evidence that `Fv47` branch in Haugesund is signed, not mentioned on wikipedia. Indicated on OSM and vegvesen.no/vegkart
- `Fv118` branch to `E6` exit 1 should be signed now but GSV is out-dated (2009/10), not drafted
- `Fv120` and `Fv128` must be checked for exact E18 wp locations and labels
- `Fv128` end points are not clear. According to vegvesen.no, the east end is at E18 exit west of Ørje but GSV is out-dated (2010) and GM/OSM don't indicate it (unsigned Fv818); west end is `E18` on vegvesen.no, OSM indicates it east of Elvestad only; both are not drafted
- `Fv130`, `Fv131`, `Fv132`, `Fv153`, `Fv161`, `Fv162`, `Fv163` and `Fv182` are listed on wikipedia but they are unsigned county or communal roads (the article can easily be identified because the titles have an additional name in brackets)
- `Fv155` segment from E18 to east of E6 is a municipal road of Oslo city and only signed with dotted frame which means "to Fv155" according to GSV from 2016; confirmed by vegvesen.no; segment not drafted
- `Ring 2` (former `Fv161`) is a municipal road of Oslo city but signed like Fv routes; not drafted though
- `Ring 1` is signed like `Ring 2` but state-owned `Rv162` according to wikipedia but no `Rv162` signs according to GSV from 2016
- `Fv168` eastern segment is a municipal road of Oslo city and not signed according to GSV from 2016 (was signed in 2010 though)
- `Fv256` according to wikipedia description (and GM) is `Fv319` according to vegvesen.no and OSM; not drafted
- `Fv312` is indicated different on wikipedia but OSM, GM and (old) GSV show it like other signed Fv roads
- `Fv313` is interrupted because the Holmestrandtunnelen is closed since 2012
